    Engine now reuses what is extracted by installer rather than copying them into various places.

    Engine installer extracts dependencies into ENGINE_WORKSPACE/offline folder to use later on.
    What is extracted into this folder was originally copied into various places unnecessarily.
    Engine now reuses what is extracted from that location rather than copying them. This is done
    by symlinking folders to corresponding places. Some examples are
        ENGINE_WORKSPACE/offline/dib --> /httpboot
        ENGINE_WORKSPACE/offline/git --> ENGINE_CACHE/repos
    Nginx root is also switched to ENGINE_WORKSPACE/offline so everything is directly served from
    the location where the dependencies are extracted.
