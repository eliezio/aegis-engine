# TODO: Since localhost now uses venv interpreter to Ansible, we also need to have
# python-apt in the venv.
# However as described in: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/14468
# it is not possible to install python-apt into the venv using standard means.
# Work around is to download python-apt and copy it to the venv manually.
