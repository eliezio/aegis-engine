# This file contains engine binary requirements.
#
# Currently only ubuntu dependencies are listed and dependencies for other
# platforms will be added going forward. Some dependencies might be named
# same on different platforms and they can be combined wherever needed.
#
# An important point to highlight here is that this file contains all the
# dependencies that is potentially needed for various combinations and
# scenarios supported by the framework. This means that we might be installing
# some unnecessary dependencies for the scenarios supported by the framework
# by collecting everything in one place. An example to this is installing
# libvirt dependencies that are not actually needed for cloud/heat based
# deployments. However, this is a very small cost comparing the benefits we
# get such as having ability to list, manage, and install platform specific
# packages in one place or for pinning versions to ensure reproducibility.
# If we see the need to adjust and limit the packages we need to install
# dependending on scenario, we can fine tune what is installed where by
# introducing profiles for bindep.
#
# Finally, this list currently only contains the dependencies required for
# the engine itself meaning that the dependencies required for scenarios that
# are developed in swconfig repo is not part of the file. They will be included
# and controlled using this file over time once the basics are in place.
